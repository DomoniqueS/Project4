 <p>I was in a point in my life when I thought I couldn't do it anymore and I thought my life and others  would be fine if I was gone. So I had everything planned out until one day we had a play at my school based off of suicide and they have gave us these books with hotlines we can call so I decided to give life one more time. I called the hotline explain my story and I didn't feel better but I felt like I could make it.</p>
