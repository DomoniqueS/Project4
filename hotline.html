<p>For Teens, young Adults, and Adults who feel like they can do it or they are close to the edge should Suicide Prevention Club. It's a private Hotline so everything you talk about won't be told to your parents or the Adult figure in your life. Its also not mandatory to state your name if you do not want to, but i really suggest that if you're feeling down or just need someone to vent to because you feel like there is no one around you that you can talk to call them. They are not going to judge you or tell you what you want to here or make it seem like you're going through a small mid-life crisis. They will listen and tell you what you need to hear to get through this rough time in your life.</p>
